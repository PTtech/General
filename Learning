We hope this message finds you well. As part of our commitment to providing a secure and seamless user experience, we are updating our iOS version requirements and upgrade policy. Please take a moment to review the following guidelines:

Alignment with Apple iOS Releases: We will align our application with the latest major version released by Apple.

Supported iOS Versions: We will support the current iOS version and the previous major version. This means our application will be compatible with the latest iOS release and the one preceding it.

Minimum Build Version Mandate: The minimum build version will be mandated based on careful analysis using the following conditions:

(1) Case-by-case Analysis: Each iOS version will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors.
(2) Major Vulnerabilities Impact: If significant vulnerabilities are found in an iOS version, and the impact is deemed major, we will mandate upgrading to a more secure version.
(3) Agent Application Support: The minimum build version will be determined based on ensuring all agent applications are fully supported, without any adverse effects.
(4) Current Usage and Impact Analysis: We will analyze the current usage of specific iOS versions to assess the overall impact of mandating an upgrade.
Notification and Grace Period: When a new minimum build version is mandated, we will notify all agents with ample time to upgrade. You will receive a notification with the mandate details and a 60-day grace period to perform the necessary upgrades.

Updating MDM Configuration: After the 60-day grace period, we will update the Mobile Device Management (MDM) configuration as follows:

(i) Least Supported Minimum Build Version: The MDM configuration will reflect the least supported minimum build version. Agents using older versions beyond this point will be unable to access the application.
We understand the importance of having a secure and reliable application to carry out your tasks efficiently. These version requirements and upgrade measures are implemented to ensure a smooth and secure experience for all agents.

If you have any questions or concerns about this update, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team. Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining a secure working environment.



Objective:

The purpose of this document is to outline the iOS version requirements and upgrade policy for our application. By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to ensure a secure and optimal user experience for all agents.

iOS Version Requirements and Upgrade Policy:

Alignment with Apple iOS Releases:

Our application will align with the latest major version released by Apple for iOS.
Supported iOS Versions:

We will support the current iOS version and the previous major version. This means our application will be compatible with the latest iOS release and the one preceding it.
Minimum Build Version Mandate:

The minimum build version will be mandated based on the following conditions:
Case-by-case Analysis: Each iOS version will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, considering various factors.
Major Vulnerabilities Impact: If significant vulnerabilities are found in an iOS version, and the impact is deemed major, we will mandate upgrading to a more secure version.
Agent Application Support: The minimum build version will be determined based on ensuring all agent applications are fully supported, without any adverse effects.
Current Usage and Impact Analysis: We will analyze the current usage of specific iOS versions to assess the overall impact of mandating an upgrade.
Notification and Grace Period:

When a new minimum build version is mandated, we will notify all agents to provide sufficient time for upgrades.
Agents will receive a notification with the mandate details and a 60-day grace period to perform the necessary upgrades.
Updating MDM Configuration:

After the 60-day grace period, we will update the Mobile Device Management (MDM) configuration as follows:
Least Supported Minimum Build Version: The MDM configuration will reflect the least supported minimum build version.
Agents using older versions beyond this point will be unable to access the application.
Benefits:

By aligning with the latest iOS version, agents will have access to new features and improvements introduced by Apple.
Supporting the current and one prior iOS version ensures compatibility and a smooth experience for most users.
Mandating a minimum build version based on careful analysis safeguards against potential vulnerabilities and security risks.
The 60-day grace period allows sufficient time for agents to upgrade their devices and maintain access to the application.
Conclusion:

We value the security and user experience of our agents, and these iOS version requirements and upgrade policies are put in place to provide a secure and efficient working environment. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please reach out to our support team.
